**Shell Scripting - Detailed Notes**

**1. What is Shell Scripting?**
A Shell Script is a program written in a shell (command-line interpreter) to automate tasks in Linux/Unix. It consists of a series of commands that are executed sequentially.

**2. Why Use Shell Scripting?**

Automates repetitive tasks
Reduces manual intervention
Enhances system administration
Used in CI/CD pipelines, cloud automation, and data processing
**3. Different Types of Shells**
Bash (Bourne Again Shell) – Most common shell
Sh (Bourne Shell) – The original Unix shell
Ksh (Korn Shell) – Advanced version of Bourne Shell
Csh (C Shell) – Uses C-like syntax
Zsh (Z Shell) – Powerful and feature-rich
**4. Basic Shell Scripting Syntax**

Shebang (#!) – First line specifying the interpreter
sh

#!/bin/bash
Comments – Lines beginning with # are ignored

# This is a comment
Echo Command – Print output to the terminal

echo "Hello, World!"
Variables – Used to store values
name="John"
echo "Hello, $name"
Reading User Input
echo "Enter your name: "
read username
echo "Welcome, $username!"
Command Substitution
sh
Copy
Edit
today=$(date)
echo "Today's date is $today"
5. Conditional Statements
If-Else Statement
sh
Copy
Edit
if [ $num -gt 10 ]; then
  echo "Number is greater than 10"
else
  echo "Number is 10 or less"
fi
Case Statement
sh
Copy
Edit
echo "Enter a choice: "
read choice
case $choice in
  1) echo "Option 1 selected" ;;
  2) echo "Option 2 selected" ;;
  *) echo "Invalid option" ;;
esac
6. Loops
For Loop
sh
Copy
Edit
for i in {1..5}; do
  echo "Iteration $i"
done
While Loop
sh
Copy
Edit
count=1
while [ $count -le 5 ]; do
  echo "Count: $count"
  ((count++))
done
7. Functions
sh
Copy
Edit
function greet() {
  echo "Hello, $1!"
}

greet "Alice"
8. File Handling
Writing to a File
sh
Copy
Edit
echo "This is a test file" > file.txt
Reading from a File
sh
Copy
Edit
cat file.txt
Appending to a File
sh
Copy
Edit
echo "Appending this line" >> file.txt
9. Debugging Shell Scripts
Use the -x option to debug:

sh
Copy
Edit
bash -x script.sh
Preparation Points for Shell Scripting
Basic Concepts

Intermediate Concepts
✅ Understand functions and command-line arguments
✅ Work with files (read, write, append)
✅ Master process management (ps, kill, jobs, bg, fg)
✅ Use redirections (>, >>, <, 2>, &>)
✅ Use pipes (|) to chain commands
✅ Automate tasks using cron jobs (crontab -e)

Advanced Concepts
✅ Master shell script debugging (set -x, set -e)
✅ Work with arrays and associative arrays
✅ Use grep, awk, and sed for text processing
✅ Understand networking commands (ping, curl, wget, netstat)
✅ Optimize shell scripts for performance

Real-World Applications
✅ Write scripts for system administration (user management, backups)
✅ Automate application deployments
✅ Work with cloud automation (AWS CLI, Terraform scripts)
✅ Schedule cron jobs for monitoring and maintenance

Here’s a hands-on practice guide for shell scripting along with sample scripts to help you prepare efficiently. 🚀

🔹 Shell Scripting Practice Guide
📌 1. Basic Shell Commands
👉 Task: Create a script that prints "Hello, World!"
📜 Script:

sh
Copy
Edit
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, World!"
🔹 Run it:

sh
Copy
Edit
chmod +x hello.sh
./hello.sh

👉 Task: Write a script that takes a user's name as input and greets them.
📜 Script:

sh
Copy
Edit
#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter your name:"
read name
echo "Hello, $name! Welcome to shell scripting."
📌 3. Arithmetic Operations
👉 Task: Create a script that adds two numbers given by the user.
📜 Script:

sh
Copy
Edit
#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter first number:"
read num1
echo "Enter second number:"
read num2
sum=$((num1 + num2))
echo "Sum is: $sum"
📌 4. If-Else Condition
👉 Task: Check if a number is even or odd.
📜 Script:

sh
Copy
Edit
#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter a number:"
read num
if (( num % 2 == 0 )); then
  echo "$num is even"
else
  echo "$num is odd"
fi
📌 5. For Loop
👉 Task: Print numbers from 1 to 5 using a loop.
📜 Script:

sh
Copy
Edit
#!/bin/bash
for i in {1..5}; do
  echo "Number: $i"
done
📌 6. While Loop
👉 Task: Print numbers from 1 to 5 using a while loop.

sh
Copy
Edit
#!/bin/bash
count=1
while [ $count -le 5 ]; do
  echo "Count: $count"
  ((count++))
done
📌 7. Functions in Shell

brief on AWK command with examples
ChatGPT said:
AWK Command in Shell Scripting – A Quick Guide
AWK is a powerful text-processing tool used in Linux/Unix for pattern scanning, data extraction, and reporting. It operates on structured data like logs, CSVs, and tabular formats.

📌 Syntax of AWK
sh
Copy
Edit
awk 'pattern {action}' filename
pattern → Defines what to match (optional)
action → Specifies what to do when a match is found
filename → The input file to process
📌 Basic Examples of AWK
1️⃣ Print Entire File
sh
Copy
Edit
awk '{print}' myfile.txt
🔹 Prints all lines of myfile.txt.

2️⃣ Print Specific Column
sh
Copy
Edit
awk '{print $2}' myfile.txt
🔹 Prints the second column of each line.
(AWK treats whitespace as the default field separator.)

3️⃣ Print Line Numbers
sh
Copy
Edit
awk '{print NR, $0}' myfile.txt
🔹 Adds line numbers before each line.

4️⃣ Filtering Rows Based on a Condition
sh
Copy
Edit
awk '$3 > 50 {print $1, $3}' data.txt
🔹 Prints the first and third column only if the third column is greater than 50.

5️⃣ Using Field Separator (FS)
sh
Copy
Edit
awk -F',' '{print $1, $3}' mydata.csv
🔹 -F',' sets , as the delimiter for CSV files.

6️⃣ Print Only Matching Lines
sh
Copy
Edit
awk '/error/ {print}' logfile.txt
🔹 Prints only lines containing "error" from logfile.txt.

7️⃣ Print Lines Within a Range
sh
Copy
Edit
awk 'NR==5, NR==10' myfile.txt
🔹 Prints lines 5 to 10.

8️⃣ AWK with BEGIN & END Blocks
sh
Copy
Edit
awk 'BEGIN {print "Start Processing"} {print $1} END {print "Processing Complete"}' myfile.txt
🔹 BEGIN runs before reading the file.
🔹 END runs after reading the file.

9️⃣ Sum of a Column (Example: Sales Data)
sh
Copy
Edit
awk '{sum += $2} END {print "Total:", sum}' sales.txt
🔹 Adds up all values in the second column and prints the total.

🔟 Count Word Occurrences
sh
Copy
Edit
awk '{for (i=1; i<=NF; i++) count[$i]++} END {for (word in count) print word, count[word]}' words.txt
🔹 Counts occurrences of each word in words.txt.

🔥 Advanced Use Cases
🔹 Extract failed logins from system logs
🔹 Generate a report from a CSV file
🔹 Find the highest or lowest value in a dataset
